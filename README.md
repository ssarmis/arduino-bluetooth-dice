# A simple Arduino bluetooth project

Just send a `1` to the bluetooth module, HC-05 in this case, and it works like a charm.<br>
Also, I didn't implement any randomize function, I used the Arduino's default one, if you want to use your own, just replace the ```random``` and ```randomSeed``` functions from the code with your own and you're done.
